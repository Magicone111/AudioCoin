### What is AudioCoin?
[AudioCoin](http://www.audiocoin.eu/) (abbreviated ADC), 
HELPING ARTISTS & FANS TAKE BACK MUSIC
Let's face it the music industry isn't working. Spotify isn't helping artists
and most music fans have got used to paying nothing or very little for their music.

Enter AudioCoin (ADC). Our game changing, decentralised music currency rewards fans 
and artists at the same time. Interested? Sign up for your Free coins http://www.audiocoin.eu

Latest Wallet releases can be found at https://github.com/aurovine/AudioCoin/releases
